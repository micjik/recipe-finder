challenges encounter while building this project
* Instead of using NavLink. I used Link and this gave me alot of issues due to the fact that I want one of the url to be active which cannot be applicable using Link. The NavLink gives you isActive property in order for you to uniquely identify a particular recipe

* Forgot to install react-router-dom so when I import useParams() in order to uniquely identify a particular recipe id, it wasn't working.
